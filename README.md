# 🔱 Trinetra Sthithi — AI-Powered Consciousness Grid for Simhastha 2028  

**Rasi Solutions** presents Trinetra Sthithi, an AI-powered **safety and harmony system** for the Ujjain Mahakumbh (Simhastha 2028). Inspired by Lord Shiva’s divine *Trinetra*, it senses, predicts, and harmonizes human energy flows — ensuring safe, balanced, and spiritually uplifting experiences for millions of pilgrims.  

## 🌍 What It Does  

Trinetra Sthithi is not just a monitoring tool — it is a **living nervous system for the Mela**:  

- 🧠 **Thinks** — Predicts crowd pressure using real-time multi-sensor fusion  
- 💓 **Feels** — Understands heat stress, noise agitation, emotional cues  
- 🗣️ **Speaks** — Guides pilgrims & volunteers via lights, signs, chants, and multilingual audio  
- 📈 **Learns** — Adapts to new behaviors and patterns as the event unfolds  

## ⚙️ How It Works (Current Prototype)  

1. **Zone Intelligence Grid (ZLI)**  
   - Inputs: crowd density, temperature, noise, kiosk feedback  
   - Outputs: Zone Load Index (ZLI) per ghat/zone  

2. **Dashboard (React + Node.js + Python)**  
   - Live **zone cards** with ZLI, crowd, noise, temperature  
   - **Alerts** when risk thresholds are crossed  
   - **AI Co-Pilot Suggestions** ranked by urgency  
   - **Shanti Pulse** button — sends calming guidance actions  

3. **Simulator**  
   - Python & Node.js scripts generate realistic sensor data  
   - Allows demo-ready, hackathon-ready testing  

## ✨ Key Features Today  

- Real-time Zone Load Index (ZLI) monitoring  
- AI Co-Pilot — actionable safety suggestions  
- Alerts for crowd surges, heat stress, and high noise  
- Shanti Pulse intervention system  
- Auto-dispatch with undo option  
- Modern, responsive **live dashboard** with sticky AI sidebar  

## 🚀 Future Roadmap  

- 🛰️ **Edge AI SmartZones** — offline autonomous safety nodes  
- 🌡️ **Thermal + Radar Sensors** — congestion & heat detection in all conditions  
- 🔊 **AI Acoustic Sensing** — detect panic, chanting, or distress instantly  
- 🌱 **ESG-AI** — bio-waste & gas detection for eco-friendly management  
- 🟩🟨🟥 **Zone Harmony Color Language (ZHCL)** — universal crowd guidance  
- 🧘 **Shanti Pulse 2.0** — synchronized chants, light pulses & breathing visuals  
- 🌐 **LoRa Mesh Networking** — works even without Wi-Fi/5G  
- 🤝 **Pilgrim Feedback Grid** — QR/kiosk-powered feedback loop  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Accessibility First** — AI sign-language avatars, multilingual voice alerts  
- 🗺️ **Digital Twin of Ujjain** — live predictive simulation map
